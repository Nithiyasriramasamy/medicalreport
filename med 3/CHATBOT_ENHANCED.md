## 💡 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Understanding a Test
**You:** "What is hemoglobin?"

**AI Response:**
```
🔴 Hemoglobin (Hb) is a crucial protein found in red blood cells 
that carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body and 
returns carbon dioxide back to your lungs.

**Key Functions:**
• Oxygen transport throughout the body
• Gives blood its red color
• Essential for cellular energy production
• Maintains acid-base balance

**Normal Ranges:**
• Men: 14-18 g/dL
• Women: 12-16 g/dL
• Children: 11-13 g/dL
```

### Example 2: Understanding Low Results
**You:** "Why is my hemoglobin low?"

**AI Response:**
```
⚠️ Low Hemoglobin (Anemia) means your blood isn't carrying 
enough oxygen to your body's tissues.

**Common Symptoms:**
• Persistent fatigue and weakness
• Pale skin and nail beds
• Shortness of breath
• Dizziness or lightheadedness
• Cold hands and feet
• Rapid or irregular heartbeat

**Possible Causes:**
• Iron deficiency (most common)
• Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
• Chronic diseases (kidney disease, cancer)

• Bone marrow problems
• Inherited conditions (sickle cell, thalassemia)

**When to See a Doctor:**
Consult immediately if you experience severe fatigue, 
chest pain, or difficulty breathing.
```
